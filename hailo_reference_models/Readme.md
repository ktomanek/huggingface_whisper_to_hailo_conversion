converted openai whisper to hailo's onnx format
this is what Hailo expects, we call that reference models

Note:
the actual conversion was run on Ubuntu machine:
/home/katrintomanek/dev/hailo_dfc/hailo-whisper/export

--> hailo-whisper was installed there with the setup.py logic and hence gotten the whisper patch
