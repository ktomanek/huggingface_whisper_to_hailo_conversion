# Practical Efficiency Notes: Whisper ONNX Conversion for Hailo NPU

## Key Insights Summary

### The Hallucination Problem

**Symptom:**
When using a 10s encoder (output: `[1, 500, 384]`) with standard HuggingFace decoder models (trained on 30s encoder output: `[1, 1500, 384]`), the model hallucinates by repeating phrases indefinitely instead of stopping with EOS token.

**Root Cause:**
Distribution shift - the decoder was never trained on encoder sequences shorter than 1500 positions. Even though ONNX accepts variable-length inputs, the model's learned patterns expect ~1500 positions and don't know how to handle abruptly truncated sequences.

**Why This Happens:**
- Original Whisper always pads audio to 30 seconds before encoding ‚Üí decoder always sees 1500 positions
- Your 10s encoder produces only 500 positions
- The decoder's cross-attention and learned patterns are confused by the missing 1000 positions
- Result: Model doesn't confidently predict EOS, gets stuck repeating the last phrase

### Three Solution Strategies

#### 1. **Encoder Output Padding** (Recommended)
Pad the 500-position encoder output to match training distribution:

| Padding Target | Result | Cross-Attention Overhead |
|---------------|---------|-------------------------|
| 500 (no padding) | Hallucinations | 1.0x (baseline) |
| 600-650 | Some hallucinations | 1.2-1.3x |
| 700+ | Reliable stopping | 1.4x |
| 1500 (full) | Most reliable | 3.0x |

**Key Finding:** Minimum ~200 padding positions (total 700) needed for reliable EOS prediction. This represents ~40% buffer beyond actual content.

**Why Padding Works:**
- Gives decoder the spatial structure it expects
- Zeros at end create implicit boundary signal
- Model learns "low activation in later positions = speech ended"
- Not the same as encoded silence, but sufficient for stopping cue

#### 2. **Repetition Penalty** (Complementary)
Penalize already-generated tokens by dividing their logit scores:

```python
for token_id in previously_generated:
    if logits[token_id] > 0:
        logits[token_id] /= penalty  # e.g., divide by 1.2
    else:
        logits[token_id] *= penalty  # make more negative
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Prevents repetition loops
- ‚úÖ Minimal computational cost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May prevent legitimate repetitions ("New York, New York")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Doesn't address root cause (distribution mismatch)

#### 3. **EOS Boosting** (Proactive Early Stopping)
Force EOS when it's competitive with top token:

```python
if (max_score - eos_score) < threshold:  # e.g., 0.5
    choose_eos()  # Stop generation
```

**Key Observation:** During hallucinations, EOS is often very close to the repeated token (within 0.2-0.5 logits). EOS boosting directly addresses this pattern.

**Advantages over Post-Processing:**
- ‚úÖ Stops generation immediately (saves 85-90% of wasted tokens)
- ‚úÖ No O(n¬≤) cost from generating then deleting
- ‚úÖ Much faster than generating 32 tokens then removing repetitions
- ‚úÖ Proactive prevention vs reactive cleanup

### Performance Analysis

#### The Real Cost of Padding

**First Token (Initialization):**
- Processes 4 forced tokens at once
- Cross-attention: 4 decoder positions √ó encoder_length
- 500 padding: 4 √ó 500 = 2,000 ops
- 1500 padding: 4 √ó 1500 = 6,000 ops (3x more)
- Result: First token ~3x slower with full padding

**Subsequent Tokens (Cached):**
- Processes only 1 new token
- Cross-attention: 1 decoder position √ó encoder_length
- 500 padding: 1 √ó 500 = 500 ops
- 1500 padding: 1 √ó 1500 = 1,500 ops (3x more)
- Result: Subsequent tokens only ~1.5-2x slower (smaller fraction of total work)

**Padding Overhead is Amortized:**
- Cross-attention ‚âà 30% of decoder compute
- 3x padding ‚Üí ~1.9x actual slowdown (not 3x)
- Early stopping (3-15 tokens vs 32) saves more than padding costs
- Padding to 1500 is **still 6-9x faster** than NPU no-cache approach

#### Comparison: Padding vs NPU No-Cache

| Approach | Per-Token Cost | Total for 15 tokens | Key Limitation |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **NPU (no cache)** | ~150ms | ~2,250ms | 32 positions + O(n¬≤) |
| **Cached + 500 pad** | ~3ms | Hallucinations | Distribution shift |
| **Cached + 1500 pad** | ~5ms | ~80ms | 3x cross-attention |

**Verdict:** Padding overhead (1.9x) is negligible compared to no-cache overhead (30-50x). The hybrid architecture (encoder on NPU, cached decoder with padding) is optimal.

### Recommended Production Setup

**Conservative (Most Reliable):**
```python
ORIG_MAX_LEN = 1500           # Full padding to training distribution
REPETITION_PENALTY = 1.0      # Not needed
EOS_BOOST_THRESHOLD = 0.0     # Not needed
```
- Most robust across all inputs
- 2x less cross-attention than naive approach
- Still 6-9x faster than NPU no-cache

**Balanced (Good Trade-off):**
```python
ORIG_MAX_LEN = 700            # Minimal safe padding
REPETITION_PENALTY = 1.1      # Mild safety net
EOS_BOOST_THRESHOLD = 0.2     # Conservative boost
```
- Lower cross-attention overhead
- Multiple safety mechanisms
- Stops early for most inputs

**Aggressive (Maximum Speed):**
```python
ORIG_MAX_LEN = 500            # No padding
REPETITION_PENALTY = 1.2      # Stronger penalty
EOS_BOOST_THRESHOLD = 0.5     # Aggressive boost
```
- Lowest compute overhead
- Relies heavily on EOS boosting
- May have edge cases

### Why Early Stopping Matters More Than Padding

**With 1500 padding but early stopping:**
- First token: 13ms (expensive initialization)
- Next 2 tokens: 2ms each (cached, fast)
- Total: ~17ms for "Hello world."

**With 500 padding but no early stopping (hallucination):**
- All tokens: 3ms each
- But generates 32 tokens (repeated phrases)
- Total: ~96ms for garbage output

**Lesson:** Early stopping (via padding, penalty, or EOS boost) saves far more time than padding costs. The goal isn't to avoid padding‚Äîit's to stop generation as soon as the utterance is complete.
